All notable changes to "Start Building Accessible Web Applications Today‚Äù will be documented in this file.

### Added

- Created this repository.
- Added this CHANGELOG file.
- Added individual lessons as folders to be included under the master branch.
- Added small `package.json` files for all lessons including their lesson names.
- Added `info.md` file to lessons 4, 6, 9, 10, 14, 15, which include links/commands demonstrated in the lesson to enhance user experience.
- Added `<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/demo.css">` line to the `index.html` on lesson 07.
- Added `<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">` line and `<script src="script.js"></script>` line to the `index.html` on lesson 13.
- Added third button code to match lesson 13 finished code, as it was previously matching the middle of the video.

### Changed

- Corrected both file paths in lesson 12 for the scripts imported. First script changed: `<script src="node_modules/dialog-polyfill/dialog-polyfill.js"></script>` -> `<script src="node_modules/dialog-polyfill/dist/dialog-polyfill.js"></script>`. Second script changed: `<script src="node_modules/wicg-inert/inert.js"></script>` -> `<script src="node_modules/wicg-inert/dist/inert.js"></script>`.
- Changed `scripts.js` in lesson 12 to match lesson's code, as it was simply incorrect.

### Removed

- None.

### Deprecated
